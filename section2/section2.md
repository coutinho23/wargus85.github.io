## A description of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.

The advertised position is for a senior systems administrator. The role would require a number of years experience in a junior role working under a more experienced systems administrator. Drawing on the years of knowledge, experience and skills as a junior administrator, the now senior administrator would provide management with robust advice on potential new products, explain how they would integrate into existing systems and would build new systems. The senior systems administrator would delegate tasks to junior staff, mentor them and ensure training opportunities were provided.

The position appeals to me as I enjoy working on projects that have an impact on the business, working in a team and helping others reach their potential. Traditionally, the career path of a systems administrator begins on the service desk and moves up through the various levels before reaching the heights of a full systems administrator. Having started my IT career in a managed services provider as a level 1 technician, I see this as my final career stage and something I aspire to. In other words: if I were a pokemon, this position would be the ‘final stage’ in my career evolution. 

Furthermore the IT realm is in a constant state of flux which requires continuous learning and training. I would relish the opportunity to lead a team in that endeavour, setting the direction and engaging in new systems and technologies. Being a systems administrator requires a broad, varied skill-set which again, I find appealing as I honestly enjoy learning new skills and technologies. There is no standing still in IT!

## A description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.

Without overly relying on the position description, the senior systems administrator role requires an understanding of:
* Current virtualisation technology, including containerisation, cloud and on-premises server configuration and administration 
* Microsoft technology including domain creation, replication technology, group policy, federated services and Office 365 tenancy configuration.
* Networking terminology and technology.
* Backup and disaster recovery technology.

The position also lists a degree in IT as a prerequisite along with extensive experience in all of the above. Soft skills include time management and a demonstrated ability to be highly organised.

## A description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.

Please refer back to the [main page](../index.html) for an overview of my current qualifications and courses I've done recently. In brief, I can only add that I've worked in IT for over three years now and in that time have moved from a level 1 service desk position to a specialised support role at an Curtin University, a university that has been consistently ranked in the top 10 in Australia. Over my career I’ve been exposed to a myriad of technologies, ticket systems, on premises, cloud and hybrid environments and have been responsible for supporting them all.

## A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.

My plan currently extends as far as completing my Bachelor of IT and looking for secondment opportunities in systems at my current employer.
Specific to this position, I would need to gain a full time permanent position as a junior systems administrator and hold it for a number of years. To feel comfortable as the senior systems administrator with this particular position I would need to undertake further training over a number of years in:
* VMWare virtualisation technology.
* Office 365, Exchange,  Active Directory, including migration and federated services.
* Programming and automation technology, including Saltstack, Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Python, Powershell, etc.
* Gain Cisco certifications: CCNP and CCNA.
* Veeam techology.
