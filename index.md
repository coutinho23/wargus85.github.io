Hi,

I'm the Linux Desktop Support Specialist at Curtin University. I image and deploy Linux machines to researchers and academics on campus. I've always loved Linux, but love can only get you so far! I'm finding many advertisements now list a degree as a requirement (or equivalent experience) which is why I’m now undertaking a degree in IT. Please continue onto section 1 for more information...
